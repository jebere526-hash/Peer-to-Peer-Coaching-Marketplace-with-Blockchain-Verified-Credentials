# 📚 Peer-to-Peer Coaching Marketplace with Blockchain-Verified Credentials

Welcome to a decentralized platform that connects coaches and learners in a trustless environment! This Web3 project addresses the real-world problem of unverified expertise in the coaching industry, where fake credentials and lack of transparency lead to wasted time and money. By leveraging the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, coaches can prove their qualifications on-chain, and users can book sessions with confidence, all while enabling peer-to-peer payments and interactions without intermediaries.

## ✨ Features

🔍 Blockchain-verified coach credentials to ensure authenticity  
📅 Easy listing and booking of coaching sessions  
💰 Secure escrow payments in STX or SIP-10 tokens  
⭐ On-chain reviews and ratings for transparent feedback  
⚖️ Dispute resolution mechanism to handle conflicts fairly  
🚀 Decentralized governance for platform updates  
🔒 User profiles with privacy controls  
📈 Analytics for coaches to track performance  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to create a robust, decentralized ecosystem. Coaches upload verifiable credentials (e.g., certificates hashed and attested by trusted verifiers), list their services, and interact directly with learners. All transactions are immutable and transparent on the Stacks blockchain.

**For Coaches**  
- Register your profile and submit credentials for on-chain verification.  
- List coaching sessions with details like topic, duration, price, and availability.  
- Accept bookings, conduct sessions off-chain (e.g., via video call), and release escrowed funds upon completion.  
- Respond to reviews and participate in governance votes.  

**For Learners**  
- Browse verified coaches and their credentials.  
- Book sessions by depositing funds into escrow.  
- Leave reviews after sessions to build community trust.  
- Initiate disputes if needed, resolved via on-chain arbitration.  

That's it! A seamless, trust-based marketplace powered by blockchain.
